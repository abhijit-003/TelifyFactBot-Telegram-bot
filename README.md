## How It Works
### 1. Bot Initialization
- The bot is initialized using the `ApplicationBuilder()` method from the `python-telegram-bot` library.
- Logging is configured to capture information and errors.
- SQLite database (`subscriptions.db`) is used to manage user subscriptions.

### 2. Command Handling
- **Command Handlers** are set up for each command to respond to user inputs.
- **Message Handlers** catch all other general text messages that are not commands.

### 3. Fact Fetching APIs
The bot fetches content from several APIs:
- **Numbers API**: Provides trivia related to numbers.
- **Open Trivia Database API**: Supplies quiz questions.
- **Quotable API**: Fetches motivational quotes.
- **Byabbe API**: Shares historical events for the current date.
- **API Ninjas**: Provides random general facts.

### 4. Subscription Management
- Users can subscribe or unsubscribe using the `/subscribe` and `/unsubscribe` commands.
- Subscriptions are stored in an SQLite database to send daily facts.

### 5. Scheduled Tasks
- The bot uses the `APScheduler` library to schedule the sending of daily facts to all subscribed users at 9:00 AM (Asia/Kolkata timezone).
- The scheduler runs in the background and handles the timely delivery of content.

## Example Usage
### 1. Starting the Bot
```
User: /start
Bot: ðŸ¤– Welcome to the Fun Fact & Trivia Bot! ðŸŽ‰
     Use /fact for a random fact.

     Use /number [number] for number trivia.
     Use /quote - for motivational quote.
     Use /quiz for a fun quiz.
     Use /subscribe to get daily facts.
     Use /unsubscribe to stop receiving daily facts.
```

### 2. Fetching a Random Fact
```
User: /fact
Bot: ðŸ’¡ The average person walks the equivalent of three times around the world in a lifetime.
```

### 3. Getting Today's Historical Fact
```
User: /today
Bot: ðŸ“… On this day in 1989, the Berlin Wall fell, marking the end of the Cold War.
```

### 4. Subscribing to Daily Facts
```
User: /subscribe
Bot: You've subscribed to daily facts! ðŸŽ‰
```

### 5. Unsubscribing
```
User: /unsubscribe
Bot: You've unsubscribed from daily facts. ðŸ˜¢
```
